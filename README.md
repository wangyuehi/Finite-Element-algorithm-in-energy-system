# Finite-Element-Method-in-energy-system


* This is a 2D FEM implmentation for a single-sided linear induction motor (SLIM). 
* A new sparse solver was implemented based on left looking Gilbert-Peierls algorithm for the system of linear equations of FEM that need to be solved in different iterations and time steps.
